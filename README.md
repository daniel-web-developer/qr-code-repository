## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

By doing this project, I've significantly improved my CSS abilities, by both working with some properties I already knew, but didn't completely understand, and by developing new skills to implement some features.

### Continued development

One problem I'd like to tackle is my difficulty of getting measurements right. The text, for instance, is clearly not the same size as the text in the design examples.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is the main source I use to learn how to use a certain property. It's useful both for HTML and CSS (JS too, but I didn't use it in this project).
